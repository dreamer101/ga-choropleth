A D3.js choropleth example showing the costs of various natural disasters in the state of Georgia between 2010 and 2012.  The geometry data used to create the maps came from [diva-gis](http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata) and was parsed with OGR2OGR into GeoJSON and then into topoJSON (combining the county and state geometries into one data set).
